// src/scene_runtime/protocol/target_adapter.ts
//
// The single protocol-target-to-DOM identity adapter (milestone M8).
//
// Identity contract (docs/active_plans/decisions/target_identity.md, M7):
//   - placement_name is the DOM and target key. It is unique per placement
//     within a scene, so it is the only key that stays unambiguous when a scene
//     places the same object more than once.
//   - object_name is the capability / asset / STATE-store lookup key. It is
//     deliberately NON-unique (two placements of one object share one object).
//   - A protocol `target` is a semantic name. It resolves through THIS adapter
//     to exactly one placement_name (for the DOM / click / highlight side) and
//     to exactly one object_name (for the state store / object library side).
//
// This module is the ONLY place that resolution happens. The step machine
// (equality + state reads), the snapshot reducer (active_interaction_target),
// and the click resolver (DOM read-back) all route through an adapter built
// here from the current scene's placements. Building it per scene keeps the
// resolution scene-scoped: the same authored target resolves against whatever
// scene is currently mounted.
//
// Fail-loud rule: an authored target that names a NON-unique object_name (an
// object placed more than once) with no disambiguating placement_name cannot
// resolve to a single DOM element. That throws AmbiguousTargetError rather than
// silently picking one placement. Naming a specific placement_name resolves
// uniquely (the disambiguation path).
//
// Layer boundary (docs/PRIMARY_DESIGN.md): this is protocol-layer identity
// resolution over a flat list of {object_name, placement_name} bindings. It
// imports no layout, renderer, or store module; the construction layer
// (src/protocol_host.tsx) supplies the bindings from the mounted scene.

//============================================
// Public types
//============================================

// One scene placement binding: a placement's scene-unique DOM key
// (placement_name) and the object it renders (object_name). The construction
// layer projects these from the mounted scene's ComputedItems.
