// src/scene_runtime/protocol/gesture_affordance_check.ts
//
// Load-time gesture-affordance invariant.
//
// This pass runs once at protocol load, inside create_step_machine, BESIDE
// validate_protocol_presets and validate_authored_validator_values, BEFORE any
// handler closure is built and BEFORE any browser session exists. It reads
// GESTURE_REGISTRY -- the single source of registered/wired gestures -- and
// rejects any authored interaction whose gesture has no registry row or whose
// row is not wired (wired: false). A gesture with no live affordance cannot be
// completed through the visible UI, so the protocol fails loud at load rather
// than trapping a student mid-walk when the click reaches an unaffordanced step.
//
// This replaces the M2 temporary runtime guard that used to live in
// step_machine.ts, which rejected a bare click landing on an active adjust/drag
// interaction only at click time. The invariant is data-driven off
// GESTURE_REGISTRY: it hardcodes no gesture list, so it grows automatically as
// the registry adds gestures or flips a row's wired flag.
//
// The pass owns ALL error behavior for the gesture check. It never falls back,
// never returns a silent false, and never wraps work in a broad try/catch.
//
