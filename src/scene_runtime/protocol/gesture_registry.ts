// Single gesture-affordance registry keyed by the closed Gesture union. One row
// per gesture co-locates the five things the frozen affordance contract fixes
// for every gesture (docs/active_plans/decisions/affordance_contract.md, M10):
//
//   1. render      -- the visible control the student sees.
//   2. selectors   -- the stable data-* selectors the walker drives.
//   3. value       -- how the committed value leaves the affordance.
//   4. dispatch    -- the single step-machine public method the affordance calls.
//   5. walker_driver -- the visible-UI path the walker uses.
//
// This module replaces the scattered gesture-promotion shim that used to live
// inline in protocol_host.tsx (an ad-hoc ternary that decided click vs select).
// The promotion now lives in exactly one place (scene_click_to_command) and the
// single routing point (dispatch_gesture) mirrors scene_operations.ts's
// exhaustive `never` switch, so an unhandled gesture is a compile error rather
// than a silent fallthrough.
//
// All five gestures route to live step-machine methods: click, select, and
// type route through handle_click / handle_type_commit; adjust and drag route
// through handle_adjust_commit / handle_drag_commit, both fully implemented
// and wired into dispatch_gesture below. Every registry row's `wired` flag is
// true.
