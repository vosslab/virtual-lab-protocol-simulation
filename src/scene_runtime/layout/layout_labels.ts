// The _labelY seed is placement-aware (label_placement: top | bottom). top
// (default) seeds the label TOP edge above the object; bottom (legacy) seeds it
// below the row baseline. The vertical stagger below is direction-aware:
// each zone is partitioned by placement and each group ladders along its own
// direction -- bottom labels DOWN (rows away from the object below), top labels
// UP (rows away from the object above), each clamped at its own zone edge. The
// two groups are vertically disjoint and stagger independently. Cross-zone
// label-vs-artwork collision is still handled later by resolveLabelCollisions.
//
// The stagger writes only _labelX/_labelY (label coordinates). It NEVER writes
// _centerX/_baselineY (item coordinates), so item placement is unchanged and a scene whose
// labels do not collide assigns every label to row 0 and renders identically
// to the pre-stagger behavior.

//============================================
// Global 2D label de-overlap + label-vs-artwork avoidance (resolve-collisions)
//============================================
//
// layoutLabels (above) runs the legacy per-zone horizontal nudge + vertical
// stagger; it never checks a label against a NEIGHBORING object's artwork, and
// its residual check only flags same-row, adjacent-pair label overlaps. The
// resolve-collisions phase adds a global pass that runs AFTER labels are placed,
// resolving BOTH label-vs-artwork and label-vs-label overlaps across every zone
// using the shared geometry primitive (detectCollision / buildResolutionCandidate).
//
// Movement model (closed set of moves, DIRECTION-AWARE per placement):
// - Artwork boxes are obstacles; they never move. Only label boxes move.
// - Each label carries a placementMode ("top" | "bottom") resolved from the same
//   per-placement-then-scene-default chain layoutLabels used. The vertical move
//   set is mirrored by mode: a bottom label may only step DOWN (toward the padded
//   zone floor, away from the object above it); a top label may only step UP
//   (toward the padded zone top, away from the object below it). A label is never
//   pushed across its object, which would re-collide on the far side.
// - Allowed moves: a horizontal nudge along the label's x axis, or a discrete
//   row step (whole labelLineHeightPct increments) in the label's own vertical
//   direction. For an artwork collision the resolver enumerates BOTH vertical
//   candidates that exist for the mode (a bottom label: step down clearing the
//   obstacle bottom; a top label: step up clearing the obstacle top) plus the two
//   horizontal nudges, bounded by bottomMax (down) and topMin (up); the scorer
//   picks the cheapest deterministically. The geometry's suggestedAxis breaks ties.
//   EXCEPT:
//   - label-vs-artwork avoidance has PRIORITY over label-label spacing: an
//     artwork collision is always resolved before a label-label collision for
//     the same label in the same pass.
//   - if a horizontal nudge would push the label outside its zone bounds, a row
//     step is used instead (keep labels inside the padded zone).
//   - full containment (Collision.aInB / bInA: the label sits entirely inside an
//     object box) cannot be cleared by one interval-separation step, so it forces
//     a (larger) row step in the label's own direction.
// - When clearing an artwork collision re-introduces a label-label overlap, the
//   per-zone re-stagger (Phase B) re-separates that group in its own direction.
//
// Determinism: labels are visited in a fixed order (_labelX, then placement_name
// tiebreak); each label resolves its single deepest current collision per visit;
// a fixed pass budget (config.labelMaxResolvePasses, default 4) bounds the sweep
// and it stops early when a pass makes no move. Identical input -> identical
// output.
//
// End-state classification (severity diagnostics, returned to run_pipeline):
// - a label still overlapping after the budget -> unresolved_label_overlap Error.
// - a label clear of overlaps but far from its IDEAL UNCLAMPED seed anchor ->
//   poor_label_alignment Warning. anchorY is the ideal seed Y (NOT the clamped
//   seed), so a label held at a zone edge by the seed-level clamp is flagged just
//   as a label displaced by a collision move is. The diagnostic carries cause
//   context (clamp drift vs collision displacement) in its payload's attempted
//   moves so the single reused code stays interpretable.
// - a dense-but-readable cluster (many labels packed into deep rows but all
//   clear) -> possible_overload Review-required.

// Mutable working record for one label during de-overlap. The label box is
// recomputed from x/y/half/lineH on demand. anchorX / anchorY are the label's
// IDEAL UNCLAMPED seed position (the y the seed formula would produce with no
// zone-edge clamp and no stagger), used to measure drift for poor_label_alignment
// so a clamp-displaced label is flagged the same as a collision-displaced one.
// rowStep is the discrete row-step increment (one labelLineHeightPct).
// placementMode is the label's resolved placement ("top" | "bottom"); it gates
// the vertical move DIRECTION (top steps up, bottom steps down) so a label is
// never pushed across its own object.
