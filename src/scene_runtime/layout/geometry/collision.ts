// - Compute x-overlap and y-overlap as interval overlaps. Boxes collide only
//   when BOTH overlaps are strictly positive; treat touching edges
//   (overlap === 0) as separated.
// - overlapAxis is the axis of smaller positive overlap; tie-break x first when
//   x-overlap === y-overlap.
// - separationForA lies on overlapAxis with the sign that moves A clear of B
//   (the side A's center sits on relative to B's center); magnitude ===
//   overlapDepth. separationForB is its exact negation.
// - aInB / bInA: true unless one box's edge falls outside the other on the
//   tested axis (containment on both axes).
