// Stage 8: Vertical placement -- consumes the computed zone bands.
//
// This stage runs AFTER measure-vertical and reflow-zones. Those stages measured
// each item's side-independent combined extent (object height + label offset +
// wrapped label box) and reflowed the scene's vertical range into a computed band
// per zone, each band carrying its depth-tier rows (one row per depth_tier, the
// row as tall as its tallest member, spaced top-to-bottom with the tier gap). This
// stage derives ONE shared baseline (shelf line) per tier row and anchors every
// item in the row to it, so a row of unequal-height objects sits on one common line.
//
// heightPct = visualWidth * (viewport.w / viewport.h) / aspect. Keeps pixel
// aspect invariant regardless of viewport shape (percent units are per-axis).
//
// Objects keep their NATURAL height (no per-object shrink). The reflow already
// reserved a row tall enough for object + gap + label, so the object never needs to
// be squeezed to make room for its label. A scene whose measured content exceeds the
// scene range is handled by the scene-wide uniform object rescale, not by a
// per-object shrink here. Keeping natural height makes "an object covers its own
// label" structurally impossible and is never-crop safe by construction (aspect is
// never distorted, the artwork is never clipped to a too-short card).
//
// Bottom-anchor placement: the row shelf baseline sits at the row bottom, pulled UP
// by any bottom-side label reserve and floored so the tallest object stays framed
// (see rowBaselineFor). An item's anchor_y maps the shared baseline to its _top:
// "bottom" (the default) puts the object bottom on the shelf; "tip" hangs the object
// by its tip; "top" is a centered engine fallback. Because the whole row shares one
// baseline, every bottom/tip object's bottom edge lands on the same line. _baselineY
// stores that shared shelf line; the label stage seeds labels from the object box
// (_top, _height), not from _baselineY.
