// Promotions from report-only signals to severity-graded diagnostics (M17).
//
// Two promotions live here, both turning an existing report-only observation into
// a graded SeverityDiagnostic the severity stream (and, later, the build gate)
// can act on:
//   - promoteBelowViewport: each fully_off_canvas off-canvas finding becomes a
//     build-failing art_below_viewport Error. This is the PREVENTIVE never-crop
//     regression guard; 0 real scenes trip it today.
//   - collectUnfittableAssets: each final item shrunk below the readable floor
//     becomes an advisory unfittable_asset Warning (never fails the build).
//
// Both are pure: they read their inputs and return new diagnostics, mutating
// nothing. Keeping them here (rather than inline in run_pipeline) gives the two
// promotions one testable home and keeps run_pipeline's assembly readable.

//============================================

// Promote every fully_off_canvas off-canvas finding to a build-failing
// art_below_viewport Error. partial_overflow findings are left in the report-only
// off-canvas stream and are NOT promoted (they still touch the canvas). Returns
// one Error per fully-off-canvas item, in input order; an empty list means no
// item is fully off canvas.

// Unfittable-asset advisory (D2 warning-only)
//============================================

// Emit an advisory unfittable_asset Warning for each item whose final rendered
// scale fell below the readable floor. An item only reaches a sub-floor scale
// through the terminal uniform rescale (the horizontal stage floors at MIN_SCALE),
// so this names the objects a dense scene squeezed past a readable size. Warning
// only: it never fails the build. Returns one Warning per unfittable item, in
// input order.
