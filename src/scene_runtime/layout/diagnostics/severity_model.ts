// Severity-graded diagnostic model. Ratified contract:
//   docs/active_plans/decisions/layout_model_layer_synthesis.md
//   ("Decision metadata") and plan partitioned-shimmying-dragonfly.md
//   ("Diagnostic severity table"; "Actionable payload").
//
// This file implements the severity table as typed data plus the typed
// diagnostic-record shape that carries severity, fail_build, likely owner, a
// YAML pointer, the trigger, and a suggested fix for each diagnostic code. It is
// pure data + helpers: it does NOT emit diagnostics, mutate layout, or read the
// scene. Layout stages call buildDiagnostic(code, ...) when they detect the
// trigger condition for a code.
//
// All coordinates referenced by payloads are scene-percent (0..100 per axis),
// matching the layout engine convention.
