// Unified layout diagnostics stream (M17).
//
// PipelineResult historically carried four inconsistent diagnostic streams:
//   - `diagnostics`        : the legacy closed-kind Diagnostic[] (identity + placement)
//   - `passes[].diagnostics`: the same closed-kind stream, one array per convergence pass
//   - `severityDiagnostics`: the severity-graded SeverityDiagnostic[] (build gate)
//   - `offCanvasDiagnostics`: the report-only per-item off-canvas classification
//
// Each has its own record shape and its own severity spelling, so a report tool
// had to know all four to answer "what is wrong with this scene". This module
// folds all four into ONE flat, normalized record (UnifiedDiagnostic) so a single
// consumer can read one array. It is the long-term single source of truth reports
// read instead of recomputing from the engine (see the plan's "Diagnostics source
// of truth" note).
//
// The build gate itself stays on `severityDiagnostics` (countBuildFailures reads
// that array). This unified stream is for reporting: `failBuild` is authoritative
// only on the severity-sourced entries; the legacy, pass, and off-canvas entries
// are report-only and carry failBuild:false even when their local grade reads
// "error". A fully-off-canvas item therefore appears twice: once as an off-canvas
// entry (report-only) and once as the promoted art_below_viewport severity entry
// (failBuild:true). The `source` tag distinguishes them, and build-failure counts
// stay correct because only the severity entry sets failBuild.
