// tests/playwright/e2e/protocol_walkthrough.spec.ts
//
// Runner-model acceptance walker sweep. This is the hard acceptance spine for
// PRIMARY_CONTRACT.md item 4: a mini-protocol is complete only when the visible
// interaction works. It emits ONE test() per curriculum protocol, so Playwright's
// native workers parallelize the sweep, and each test drives that protocol end to
// end through the SAME visible-UI walk engine the legacy CLI walker used
// (helper_walker.mjs -> walker_helpers.mjs). Real visible clicks / fill+commits
// only; NO internal-API progress; the structured material-area oracle runs around
// every material-writing interaction; screenshots land under test-results/.
//
// Convergence away from the library model (Phase 3):
//   - Discovery: helper_protocol_discovery.mjs enumerates content/protocols/**/
//     protocol.yaml (extracted so the spec does not import walk_all_protocols.mjs,
//     whose top-level main() would launch the old sweep on import).
//   - Server: the playwright.config.ts webServer block owns ONE built-and-served
//     dist/ for every worker. The custom randomPort()/startServer()/--server-url
//     injection and the bounded --jobs worker pool are REMOVED here, superseded by
//     the config webServer + Playwright workers. Each test navigates via baseURL.
//   - Honesty: a protocol that does not complete through visible UI FAILS its
//     test via expect(). The genuinely-incomplete protocols stay RED; they are the
//     correct acceptance signal, not conversion bugs to paper over.
//
// walk_all_protocols.mjs and protocol_walkthrough_yaml.mjs remain in place for
// Phase 4 removal; this spec is self-sufficient and never shells out to them.
