# Cell culture game

An interactive browser-based simulation game that teaches cell culture laboratory
techniques. Players practice aspirating old media, feeding cells with fresh media,
drug treatment pipetting, and microscope observation in a guided workflow.

## Quick start

```bash
bash export_single_file.sh
open cell_culture_game.html
```

The build script compiles TypeScript source files into a single self-contained
HTML file (rebuilt on demand if missing, and git-ignored). Open it in any
modern browser to play.
