# Virtual lab protocol simulation

Browser-based virtual lab protocol games for biology students. Authors compose scenes, objects, and workflows in YAML; the pipeline compiles them to interactive TypeScript simulations with SVG-backed objects laid out by a scene engine.

## Quick start

```bash
bash run_web_server.sh
```

Builds the project and serves `dist/` on a random port, then opens the protocol selector in your browser.

Other useful commands:

```bash
bash build_github_pages.sh   # build dist/ for deployment
bash check_codebase.sh       # typecheck, lint, and format check
source source_me.sh && pytest tests/   # run unit tests
```
