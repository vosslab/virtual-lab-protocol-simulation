# Changelog

## 2026-07-13

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- Implemented `TimedWait` as an ordered, blocking response operation. The step
  machine now pauses at each timed phase, rejects duplicate interaction input
  while waiting, and resumes the remaining response operations exactly once
  after elapsed notification. The scene store exposes runtime-only timed-phase
  flags, the object renderer shows the authored display hint in a visible status
  badge, and the browser clock compresses one laboratory hour to one second with
  a 0.5-2 second bound so long incubations remain visibly completable.
- Changed unsupported `LayoutMove` handling from a warning-only no-op to a
  descriptive exception. The ratified operation remains in the closed
  vocabulary, but the runtime no longer reports success without moving the
  placement.
- The shared numeric set-point editor now rejects blank, malformed, and
  non-finite drafts instead of silently committing zero. A rejected draft is
  surfaced through the existing visible error state and `aria-invalid`.
- `run_validate.sh` now forwards validator arguments, making
  `./run_validate.sh --strict` an explicit warning-failing entry point. Updated
  `run_fast_checks.sh` comments to describe its actual default policy: errors
  fail while warnings and advisories remain visible and non-failing.

### Tests and Quality

- Added focused regression coverage for ordered `TimedWait` pause/resume,
  duplicate-input rejection, render-state scheduling, browser-clock bounds,
  fail-loud `LayoutMove`, and set-point draft parsing.
- Updated both visible-UI walker implementations to recognize the rendered
  `data-timed-wait="active"` phase and wait for its bounded elapsed transition
  instead of misclassifying the intentional no-active-interaction interval as a
  stalled protocol.
- Rotated the 2026-07-04 day block into `docs/CHANGELOG-2026-07c.md` after the
  active changelog crossed the repository's 1000-line threshold; the active
  file retains the two newest day blocks.
- Removed stale links to the retired `tools/scorecard_m2.mjs` and
  `run_scene_health.py` entry points from the architecture, file-structure, and
  active metric-decision docs; these links were exposed by the full pytest gate.

### Additions and New Features

- Extended the scene geometry dump (WP-1B1) in `tools/scene_stats.mjs`
  `computeGeometry`: each zone entry now carries `item_union_rect`, the measured
  edge-coordinate union of every rendered item tagged with that `data-zone`
  (null when no item rendered into the zone), distinct from the declared
  `bounds`/`inner_rect`. The geometry block also carries informational
  `provenance` (`renderer_bundle` with the built bundle mtime, and `rendered_at`),
  gathered by the impure caller `tools/scene_to_png.mjs` and passed in so
  `scene_stats.mjs` stays deterministic. Re-rendered all scenes via
  `node tools/scene_to_png.mjs --all` to regenerate
  `generated/scene_render_stats/*.stats.json` with the new fields.
- Added `docs/active_plans/decisions/scene_metric_calibration.md` (WP-2A1), a
  provisional scene-metric calibration set: eight real scenes from the round-0
  vision review (`docs/active_plans/reports/aesthetic_baseline_round0.md`)
  spanning the full verdict range, each with a plain-language judgment that
  anchors the `focal_dominance` and `instructional_grouping` scores. Meets the
  coverage floor (at least four usable calibration points per metric, anchored
  high and low). Status provisional; ratification is non-blocking. Serves as the
  ground-truth reference the bbox scorecard candidates in
  `docs/active_plans/decisions/aesthetic_review_metrics.md` are calibrated
  against before any metric is promoted to a gate.
- Added `docs/specs/NO_FIXTURE_POLICY.md`, the repo-specific no-fixture policy
  ("content is the fixture": curriculum content under `content/protocols/**`
  is exercised directly by the walker sweep; there is no separate diagnostic
  fixture surface). Linked from `AGENTS.md`.
- Documented the author-entity -> codegen-decode -> DOM-glyph convention once,
  canonically, in a new "Glyph rendering" subsection of
  `docs/specs/MATERIAL_YAML_FORMAT.md`, and cross-linked it (not restated)
  from the entity/ASCII hygiene rules in `docs/specs/OBJECT_YAML_FORMAT.md`
  (unit-strings note and file-hygiene note) and
  `docs/specs/PROTOCOL_YAML_FORMAT.md`.
- Added `tests/playwright/test_glyph_dom_render.spec.ts` (WP-A4): a browser
  DOM-text proof, on the real `drug_dilution_setup` content, that the
  guidance bar (`#guidance-text`), the outline step card text, and the
  card's `title` attribute (`StepOutline.tsx:94`) all render the real
  U+00B5 micro sign glyph rather than the literal `&micro;` entity string.
  Verified non-vacuous by temporarily disabling the WP-A2 decode call and
  confirming all three assertions fail against the raw entity text, then
  restoring the decode call and confirming green.
- Added `tests/e2e/e2e_material_render.py` (WP-C1), a material-render
  regression guard: `tests/playwright/material_render_capture.mjs` renders
  every emitted scene through the real `dist/scene_viewer.html`, isolating
  each object-level `fill_height()` overlay's own painted pixels by diffing
  the same item bbox with the overlay visible vs hidden (per driving field,
  so a two-overlay object like the electrophoresis tank's inner/outer
  chamber never gets diffed against itself). The measured percent per
  `scene::placement_name::field_name` is baselined into
  `docs/active_plans/reports/material_render.json` (`--write-baseline`, or
  automatically on first run); every later run verifies against that
  baseline and flags a regression only when an entry grows more than 5
  percentage points above its recorded value, never rewriting the baseline
  itself. Per review feedback, replaced an earlier per-entry
  percent-threshold "known-bad" tag (an arbitrary per-object cutoff) with a
  single top-level `baseline_status: "known-bad-current-state"` field plus a
  `baseline_status_note`: EVERY current fill_height overlay paints the
  object's full item bbox rather than being constrained to the SVG liquid
  interior (`docs/ROADMAP.md:183`, deferred, out of scope for this guard) --
  the bug is structural to the shared overlay mechanism, not something a
  magic-number cutoff could isolate to "some" objects. The per-entry `tag`
  field stays empty, reserved for future targeted annotation once the render
  fix lands. The report header states plainly that this proves "no worse
  than baseline", not "material rendering is correct".
- Added `pipeline/entity_decode.py` (WP-A2), the codegen decode helper that
  turns authored HTML entities (named, decimal, and hex numeric forms) into
  their Unicode characters before emission into `generated/**`, so the
  runtime renders a real glyph as a normal DOM text node instead of the
  literal entity string. A closed-set dictionary lookup
  (`NAMED_ENTITY_CODEPOINTS`), not XML entity expansion, so it carries no
  XXE risk; an entity not in the map and not a valid numeric form passes
  through verbatim. Added `tests/test_entity_decode.py` covering named
  entities (`&micro;`, `&amp;`, `&alpha;`/`&beta;`), decimal and hex numeric
  forms, multi-entity strings, and the unknown-entity pass-through case.

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- WP-F1: intra-row vertical placement now BOTTOM-anchors objects to a shared
  shelf baseline instead of top-anchoring them.
  `src/scene_runtime/layout/vertical_layout.ts` routes every object through
  `anchorTop()` so `_top = _baselineY - _height`, replacing the old
  `_top = rowTop` pin plus per-object baseline back-solve (removed
  `objectTopInRow`, `baselineFromObjectTop`, `rowTopFor`). A shelf is one
  `depth_tier` across the side-by-side zones authored at the same `top..bottom`
  (a horizontal row); its shared baseline is
  `max(rowBottom - bottomLabelReserve, rowTop + maxObjHeight)` -- the lowest row
  bottom (tallest column defines the line), pulled up by any bottom-label
  reserve, and floored so the tallest object's top stays inside its row
  (containment). Result: unequal-height bottles in a row now sit their bottom
  edges on one common line (staining_bench rear reagent shelf; electrophoresis
  center working surface) instead of hanging from the row top. Aspect is
  preserved and no artwork is cropped (never-crop safe by construction). The
  reflow band/zone-merge logic and horizontal placement are untouched. Every
  pipette's `anchor_y: tip` uses `anchor_y_offset: 0`, so tips land on the shelf
  exactly like a bottom anchor; `anchor_y: top` is unused in content (engine
  fallback only). Scene-churn report:
  `docs/active_plans/reports/wp_f1_bottom_align_scene_churn.md`.
- Playwright `webServer.reuseExistingServer` is now always `false` (was `!CI`,
  i.e. reuse-allowed locally). Justification: the walker sweep
  (`tests/playwright/e2e/protocol_walkthrough.spec.ts`) intermittently failed 8
  `sdspage_*` protocols, and all 8 were a single root cause -- a stale served
  bundle, not any content, scene, asset, or runtime defect. With reuse enabled,
  a leftover `python3 -m http.server --directory dist` from an earlier run was
  reused and the `webServer` command's `build_github_pages.sh` rebuild was
  SKIPPED, so the walker booted an old `dist/protocol_host.js` whose embedded
  `PROTOCOLS` snapshot predated the sdspage protocols (observed: bundle built
  11:25, `generated/protocols.ts` regenerated 11:35). Five protocols crashed at
  boot ("protocol not found" -> `window.gameState`/`PROTOCOL_STEPS` never set ->
  `waitForFunction` 8000ms timeout, 0/0 steps); three others logged transient
  DOM-SVG fetch errors captured against that same stale build (57/2/2), which do
  not reproduce on a clean tree. Reusing a prebuilt static server decouples the
  bytes served from the current build; forcing a fresh build+serve on every run
  ties them back together. A clean rebuild turned all 8 green (`86 passed`). CI
  already ran with reuse off, which is why CI never saw this; local now matches.
- Authored HTML entities in protocol prompts/descriptions/`learning` fields,
  material names, and object labels now decode to their real Unicode glyph in
  `generated/**` via the WP-A2 codegen decode pass
  (`pipeline/entity_decode.py`), instead of shipping the literal entity
  string for the runtime to render as-is.
- Removed the `.object-graphic` box-shadow/drop-shadow styling in
  `src/style.css`; scene object artwork now renders without an added drop
  shadow.

### Fixes and Maintenance

- WP-F1: removed a now-stale `label_placement: bottom` override on
  `center_serological_pipette` in `content/base_scenes/electrophoresis_bench.yaml`
  (inherited by the eight `sdspage_*` workspace scenes via
  `extends: electrophoresis_bench`). The override existed to dodge a top-label
  collision with `ddh2o_bottle` in the OLD top-anchored layout; bottom-alignment
  moved `ddh2o_bottle` to the scene bottom, so that collision no longer exists
  and the override instead forced the label down into
  `front_left_mini_protean_gel`'s label, raising `unresolved_label_overlap` in
  all eight inheriting scenes. Removing the obsolete override lets the resolver
  place the label naturally and clears the overlap for real (no gate suppression,
  no baselined overlap).
- Fixed the dead build-freshness gate in `run_playwright_tests.sh`: it decided
  whether to rebuild `dist/` by testing for `dist/main.js`, a legacy
  single-bundle filename this multi-entry build never emits (the real runtime
  artifact is `dist/protocol_host.js`). The check now tests
  `dist/protocol_host.js` so a missing bundle actually triggers a rebuild;
  header comment updated to match.
- `pipeline/build_generated.sh` now exports `PYTHONPATH` to the repo root
  (mirroring `source_me.sh`'s own export) so the generator scripts'
  package-qualified imports resolve when the build script runs standalone,
  without requiring the caller to `source source_me.sh` first; reverted the
  in-code `sys.path` hack this previously papered over in
  `pipeline/gen_object_library.py`.
- Closeout reconciliation of `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: several agents working the
  same session had each appended their own full set of day-block
  subsection headings instead of writing under the existing one, leaving
  the 2026-07-05 and 2026-07-04 day blocks with duplicate, out-of-order
  `###` headings (per REPO_STYLE.md, one heading per category per day
  block). Merged every duplicate heading into a single instance per
  category, in canonical order, moving each existing bullet under its
  correct heading with no entry deleted or reworded. Then rotated the file
  per REPO_STYLE.md's "Changelog rotation" policy (1370 lines, over the
  1000-line threshold): ran `devel/rotate_changelog.py`, which kept the two
  most recent day blocks (2026-07-05, 2026-07-04) in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`
  and moved the older 2026-07-03 block, byte-for-byte, into the new
  `docs/CHANGELOG-2026-07b.md` archive (the existing `CHANGELOG-2026-07a.md`
  already held 07-01/07-02, so `b` is the next unused letter for the month).

### Removals and Deprecations

- Removed the `dev_smoke` `protocol_type` as a concept from the whole
  authoring and runtime surface: the Python codegen enum
  (`pipeline/gen_protocols.py`) and validator (`validation/yaml_schema`) now
  accept only `mini_protocol` and `sequence_runner`; the TypeScript
  `ProtocolKind` union dropped the third value; the runtime exemptions built
  around it were removed (`resolve_entry_scene.ts` no longer exempts an empty
  scene from the fail-loud guard; `authored_value_check.ts` dropped its
  `is_dev_smoke` plumbing). `dev_smoke`/fixture wording was purged from every
  editable local spec and doc.
- Neutered the four Playwright specs that depended on removed `dev_smoke`
  fixtures (`test_decoration_noninteractive`, `test_type_input_feedback`,
  `test_affordance_evidence`, `test_initial_scene_evidence_m1`, `.mjs` +
  `.spec.ts` pairs) to a skipped no-op with an "OBSOLETE: dev_smoke removed"
  header; their coverage is now carried by the real all-protocols walker
  sweep over `content/protocols/**`. Regenerated `generated/**` from the
  two-value protocol vocabulary; it contains zero `dev_smoke` references.
- Listed six tracked files for human `git rm` at closeout (de-referenced and,
  where executable, neutered so the gate stays green until removed):
  `tests/playwright/test_decoration_noninteractive.{mjs,spec.ts}`,
  `tests/playwright/test_type_input_feedback.{mjs,spec.ts}`,
  `tests/playwright/test_affordance_evidence.{mjs,spec.ts}`,
  `tests/playwright/test_initial_scene_evidence_m1.{mjs,spec.ts}`,
  `tests/playwright/smoke_fixtures/one_object.json`,
  `content/base_scenes_quarantine/well_plate_96_zoom.yaml`.
- Retired the "future plan may introduce a unit table doc" ASCII-unit stopgap
  in `docs/specs/OBJECT_YAML_FORMAT.md`: Greek-letter units are authored as
  HTML entities and render as their Unicode glyph via the codegen decode
  convention. Updated the two `200 uM` / `20 uL` ASCII examples in
  `docs/specs/PROTOCOL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md` to the entity form (`&micro;M`,
  `&micro;L`) so the guide teaches what now renders. Closed the
  `docs/TODO.md` "Fix unit rendering for browser-displayed YAML labels" item
  as resolved.

### Decisions and Failures

- "Content is the fixture" is now the single documented rule for exercising
  protocol behavior; `dev_smoke` is removed as a concept rather than
  reformed. `docs/PRIMARY_CONTRACT.md` never named `dev_smoke`, so this is
  not a contract change.
- Recorded `docs/active_plans/decisions/scorecard_metric_spec_discrepancy.md`
  (RATIFIED): removed the `zone_footprint_balance` and `row_overcrowding`
  scene-design scorecard metrics. Both rewarded spreading placements across
  more zones, directly conflicting with the grouping design intent in
  `docs/specs/LAYOUT_ENGINE.md` ("group related objects into one zone;
  prefer fewer, fuller zones"); a correctly-grouped scene either could not
  compute the metric or was scored worse than a scene that split itself up
  to chase evenness. Overflow coverage for an overloaded zone remains via
  scene-lint rule `B2` `item_taller_than_zone`.
- Documented tier-alignment and zone-grouping as durable design principles
  rather than one-off scene fixes: added the "Zone population and alignment
  aesthetics" section to `docs/specs/LAYOUT_ENGINE.md` (group related
  objects into one zone; prefer fewer, fuller zones; reserve separate zones
  for genuinely separate physical regions) and grouping guidance to
  `docs/specs/SCENE_DESIGN.md`.
- Tightened `AGENTS.md` to a small set of bare-path pointers into `docs/*.md`
  rather than restating rules inline, and restored the `source source_me.sh
&& python3 ...` Python-execution convention pointer that had dropped out
  of the file.

### Developer Tests and Notes

- WP-1B1 verification, all green: added two deterministic unit tests in
  `tests/test_scene_stats.mjs` (per-zone `item_union_rect` equals the edge-form
  union of same-zone item boxes, and null for an item-free zone; geometry
  `provenance` echoes the caller-supplied stamp). Added a `data-zone` membership
  assertion to both `tests/playwright/test_scene_dom_contract_selectors.mjs` and
  its `.spec.ts` sibling: every item's `data-zone` must be a declared scene zone
  (from `window.__SCENE_GEOMETRY__`), guarding the union grouping against an item
  whose zone would silently drop out of every union. `./check_codebase.sh` 5/5
  (512 node tests pass); the `.mjs` contract test passes 214/0; the two contract
  specs pass under the Playwright runner. Observed the intended measured-vs-
  declared divergence in real output (e.g. `hood_basic` rear_left
  `item_union_rect.bottom` 575 vs declared `bounds.bottom` 398).
- WP-F1 bottom-anchor verification, all green: `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0;
  `./check_codebase.sh` 5/5 (86 layout node tests pass, including rewritten
  bottom-alignment invariant tests); `precompute_layout.mjs` emitted 34 scenes
  with 0 non-exempt build failures; `e2e_layout_parity_16x9` GO 34/34 all-exact;
  `e2e_generalization_preflight` 34/34; 0 object overlaps across all 34 scenes;
  `./run_playwright_tests.sh` 86 passed / 0 failed. `passage_hood_detachment_
microscope_view` still raises 2 exempt diagnostics but is a PRE-EXISTING member
  of `BUILD_GATE_EXEMPT_SCENES` (intentional dense-by-design scene), not a
  regression from this change.
- `./run_fast_checks.sh` (renamed from `run_all_checks.sh` per the
  2026-07-04 entry below) green: 4963 pytest passed, build/typescript/pytest/
  validate all PASS. `run_validate` reports 0 errors. `./build_github_pages.sh`
  builds clean. `grep -rn dev_smoke generated/` empty. `pytest
tests/test_markdown_links.py` passed all 526 links checked.
- `./run_playwright_tests.sh` surfaced one pre-existing, unrelated failure:
  `test_scene_dom_contract_selectors.spec.ts`'s `missing_svg_check` case
  expected a scene that depended on the `tests/content/dev_smoke/` fixture
  tree removed by an earlier, separate initiative. Fixed by removing the
  obsolete `missing_svg_check` placeholder-contract case from the `.spec.ts`
  and its `.mjs` twin; `./run_playwright_tests.sh` now passes clean
  (83 passed, 5 skipped, 0 failed).
- `tests/e2e/e2e_material_render.py` verified: `--write-baseline` (after a
  full `bash build_github_pages.sh`) captured 231 fill-overlay entries across
  the 34 emitted scenes; running verify mode twice in a row reported
  `unchanged=231, regressed=0` both times (exit 0). Seeded a regression by
  lowering `bench_basic::rear_center_ethanol::material_volume`'s baselined
  `measured_percent` from 96.26 to 40.0 (a temporary edit to the baseline
  JSON, reverted immediately after) and re-running correctly raised it as the
  sole regression (`+56.26pp`, exit 1); reverting restored a clean exit-0 run
  (`unchanged=231` again). A real content-edit seed (bumping
  `micropipette.yaml`'s `held_material_volume` default, reverted) was
  attempted first but `bash build_github_pages.sh` was failing at the time on
  unrelated pre-existing `unresolved_label_overlap` gate failures in
  `electrophoresis_bench`/`extraction_workspace`/`sdspage_*` (concurrent WP-F1
  work in `vertical_layout.ts`), so the content edit was reverted without
  rebuilding and the baseline-level seed was used instead; `dist/` was
  unaffected since that gate runs before the bundle-write step. After
  replacing the per-entry threshold tag with the top-level `baseline_status`
  field (see above), re-wrote the baseline and re-ran verify mode twice more,
  confirming the new field does not trip the diff: `unchanged=231,
regressed=0, new=0, missing=0` (exit 0) both times. `pyflakes`, ASCII
  compliance, and `npx eslint` are clean on both new files.
- `tests/test_entity_decode.py` inline-case coverage (no fixture files) for
  `pipeline.entity_decode.decode_entities`: named entities, decimal
  (`&#181;`) and hex (`&#xB5;`) numeric forms, mixed strings (`Tris &amp;
EDTA`), and an unrecognized entity left verbatim.
