# Protocol YAML format

Protocol terminology is defined in [PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md](PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md). This doc uses that vocabulary.

This document specifies the three-file YAML schema for a protocol.
The protocol is author-editable at build time, not at runtime.

## Design rationale

The protocol is authored in YAML and compiled at build time into TypeScript constants.
This separation achieves:

- **Editability**: a non-coder can edit YAML in a text editor without touching code.
- **Separation of concerns**: protocol logic (branching, validation) lives in TypeScript;
  protocol content (steps, wiring, reagent properties) lives in YAML.
- **Build-time compilation**: a Python 3.12 script `pipeline/build_protocol_data.py` reads
  the YAML files and emits typed TypeScript exports. No YAML parser ships in the browser.
  The browser consumes only the generated TS constants.
- **Single source of truth**: every step, every item, every interaction is declared once
  in YAML. Drift between the banner text, the highlights, and the click handlers cannot
  happen because they all read from the same generated data structure.

## Where YAML lives

Protocol YAML files are human-authored source content. They live under `content/protocols/<cluster>/<protocol_name>/` and are compiled at build time into generated TypeScript modules. Do not edit generated output files by hand; edit the YAML source files and rebuild.

## File locations

Protocol-specific YAML files are organized in subfolders under `content/`. Each
protocol is self-contained:

```
content/
  protocols/
    <cluster>/
      <protocol_name>/
        protocol.yaml     # protocol steps, parts, and days
        materials.yaml     # materials (reagents, liquids, cells, waste)
        scenes/
          <scene_name>.yaml
  objects/
    <object_name>.yaml
  scenes/
    <base_scene_name>.yaml
```

Each mini-protocol is self-contained under `content/protocols/<cluster>/<protocol_name>/`:

- `content/protocols/<cluster>/<protocol_name>/protocol.yaml`: protocol steps, parts, and days
- `content/protocols/<cluster>/<protocol_name>/materials.yaml`: material definitions (reagents, liquids, cells, waste)
- `content/protocols/<cluster>/<protocol_name>/scenes/`: protocol-specific scene overrides

A Python generator at `pipeline/build_protocol_data.py` reads these files and emits two
TypeScript modules:

- `generated/protocol_data.ts`: exports `PROTOCOL_STEPS`, `PROTOCOL_PARTS`, `PROTOCOL_DAYS` (gitignored; re-exported by the `src/protocol.ts` facade)
- `generated/inventory_data.ts`: exports `EQUIPMENT` (item map) and `REAGENTS` (reagent map) (gitignored; re-exported by the `src/inventory.ts` facade)

### Multiple protocols

To support future protocols (e.g. western blot, flow cytometry), each protocol is a
self-contained subfolder under `content/protocols/<cluster>/`. At build time, specify the protocol:

```bash
python3 pipeline/build_protocol_data.py --protocol passage_hood_detachment
python3 pipeline/build_protocol_data.py --protocol western_blot  # future
```

To add a new protocol, copy an existing leaf such as
`content/protocols/cell_culture/passage_hood_detachment/` to
`content/protocols/<cluster>/<new_protocol_name>/`, edit the YAML files, and rebuild.

## content/protocols/&lt;protocol_name&gt;/materials.yaml

The `materials.yaml` file defines the materials used in the protocol: reagents, liquids, cells, waste, mixtures, suspensions, and diluted drugs. Materials are the things currently inside or held by an object. A material id is what an `ObjectStateChange` `scene_operation` writes into an object's flat declared `material_name` (or `held_material_name`) `state_field`.

### Materials block

Each material entry is a mapping keyed by snake_case name. All fields required.

| Field           | Type   | Description                                                                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`         | string | Display name (shown in UI and step text)                                                                                         |
| `display_color` | string | A single scalar hex string (`#rrggbb`). See [MATERIAL_YAML_FORMAT.md](MATERIAL_YAML_FORMAT.md) for the exact format and rules.   |

### Materials example

content/protocols/cell_culture/materials.yaml:

```yaml
materials:
  pbs:
    label: "1x PBS"
    display_color: "#b8e5ff"

  media:
    label: "Complete media"
    display_color: "#f7a6b8"
```

## content/protocols/&lt;protocol_name&gt;/protocol.yaml

Three top-level blocks: `parts`, `days`, and `steps`. Parts organize steps by lab workflow
part; days mark when each part runs. Steps are the runnable units of the protocol.

A required top-level `learning` block carries pedagogy metadata for every mini-protocol.

### Top-level protocol fields

| Field           | Type   | Required                                     | Description                                                                                                                          |
| --------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `protocol_type` | enum   | yes                                          | One of `mini_protocol`, `sequence_runner`, `dev_smoke`. See [PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md](PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md) Protocol kinds section. |
| `protocol_name` | string | yes                                          | Stable snake_case identifier for the protocol.                                                                                       |
| `entry_step`    | string | yes                                          | `step_name` of the first step the runtime runs.                                                                                      |
| `steps`         | list   | conditional (mini_protocol + dev_smoke only) | List of authored step entries. Absent for `sequence_runner`.                                                                         |

Example top of a mini-protocol `protocol.yaml`:

```yaml
protocol_type: mini_protocol
protocol_name: hood_flask_prep
entry_step: open_hood
```

### Learning block (required for mini-protocols)

Every mini-protocol must include a `learning` block that records the pedagogy
contract. All three sub-keys are required strings (one or two sentences each).
The block is authored metadata that documents what the mini-protocol teaches,
what students will be able to do afterward, and why the mini-protocol exists
in the broader curriculum.

| Field        | Type   | Required           | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `objectives` | string | For mini-protocols | Begins with "Students completing this mini-protocol will have achieved..." and states what students will gain fluency with.                 |
| `outcomes`   | string | For mini-protocols | Begins with "Students completing this mini-protocol will be able to..." and states what students can do after completing the mini-protocol. |
| `goals`      | string | For mini-protocols | Begins with "Overall, this mini-protocol aims to accomplish..." and states the broader purpose.                                             |

Mini-protocols use the required prefixes shown above ("Students completing this mini-protocol..."). Sequence runners also carry a `learning` block scoped to the overall pathway; for sequence runners the prefix may use "Students completing this protocol..." to describe the complete student-facing pathway. Developer smoke protocols and internal diagnostic protocols are exempt from the `learning` block requirement. See [../PRIMARY_SPEC.md](../PRIMARY_SPEC.md) for the full learning-block schema.

### Entry step (required for mini-protocols)

The top-level `entry_step` field declares where protocol flow starts. It is
required for every mini-protocol.

| Field        | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entry_step` | string | yes      | The `step_name` of the first step the runtime runs. Must match a declared step in the `steps` list. |

Example:

```yaml
entry_step: open_plate_workspace
```

The scene a protocol opens in is not a protocol-level field. Protocol YAML is
geometry-free and scene-free at the flow level; a step's interactions name
semantic `target` objects, and the scene adapter resolves those names. A
`SceneChange` `scene_operation` in a step's `response` transitions the scene
context. See [../PRIMARY_SPEC.md](../PRIMARY_SPEC.md) for the canonical entry
rule.

Validation rules: `entry_step` must name a `step_name` present in the `steps`
list. A mini-protocol must not open in the hood unless its first step takes
place in the hood; the hood is not a default starting scene.

### Sequence runner top-level shape

A sequence runner is a protocol that chains together a list of mini-protocols
rather than authoring steps directly. A sequence runner declares:

| Field            | Type            | Required | Description                                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `protocol_type`  | enum            | yes      | Must be `sequence_runner`.                                                                                     |
| `protocol_name`  | string          | yes      | Stable snake_case identifier for the sequence.                                                                 |
| `entry_step`     | string          | yes      | Must match the first mini-protocol's `entry_step`.                                                             |
| `mini_protocols` | list of strings | yes      | Ordered list of mini-protocol names; each name resolves to `content/protocols/<cluster>/<name>/protocol.yaml`. |
| `steps`          | list            | no       | Must be absent. Sequence runners do not author steps; they list constituent mini-protocols.                    |
| `learning`       | mapping         | yes      | Pedagogy block scoped to the overall pathway. Uses "Students completing this protocol..." phrasing.            |

Example:

```yaml
protocol_type: sequence_runner
protocol_name: cell_culture_full
entry_step: spray_hood
mini_protocols:
  - cell_culture_split
  - cell_culture_count_seed
  - cell_culture_drug_treatment
  - cell_culture_mtt_assay
learning:
  objectives: Students completing this protocol will have achieved competency in the full OVCAR8 cell culture and assay workflow.
  outcomes: Students completing this protocol will be able to execute a complete cell-culture-to-endpoint workflow unsupervised.
  goals: Overall, this protocol aims to accomplish integration across all mini-protocol building blocks into a single cohesive full-protocol experience.
```

Validation: The builder validates that `mini_protocols` list non-empty, each name resolves to an existing protocol YAML file, and `entry_step` matches the first mini-protocol's `entry_step`. See `validation/yaml/content_lint.py` orchestrator for the complete validation gate.

### Target resolution and the per-protocol registry

A protocol implicitly contributes every scene declared under its `scenes/`
directory plus every transitively-extended base scene to a per-protocol registry
consulted by the stepper at runtime. When a step's interaction names a `target`,
the stepper first checks the currently-active scene's placements; on miss, it
consults the registry to resolve the target across all the protocol's scenes.
No author-facing YAML keys are required to build the registry; it is derived
runtime metadata. Authors declare scenes normally in `content/protocols/<cluster>/<protocol_name>/scenes/`
and the registry builds automatically from those scenes and their base scenes.
Deactivated placements are excluded per the scene-inheritance deactivation rule;
see [SCENE_VOCABULARY.md](SCENE_VOCABULARY.md).
See [SCENE_VOCABULARY.md](SCENE_VOCABULARY.md) "## Scene-adapter resolution"
for the complete resolution algorithm and rules for ambiguous or unknown targets.

### Learning block example

Example (from `content/protocols/tutorial_plate_drug_additions/protocol.yaml`):

```yaml
learning:
  objectives:
    Students completing this mini-protocol will have achieved fluency with
    the OVCAR8 96-well plate map and the media-adjustment-before-drug ordering rule.
  outcomes: Students completing this mini-protocol will be able to dose a 96-well assay plate Day-2 unsupervised.
  goals: Overall, this mini-protocol aims to accomplish bridging the single-technique tutorials to the full OVCAR8 protocol.
```

### Parts block

List of part definitions (order matters for UI display).

| Field       | Type   | Description                                       |
| ----------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `part_name` | string | Unique snake_case identifier                      |
| `label`     | string | Display name (e.g. "Part 1: Split")               |
| `day_name`  | string | Reference to a `day_name` in the days block below |

### Days block

List of day definitions (order matters for UI display).

| Field      | Type   | Description                                          |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `day_name` | string | Unique snake_case identifier (e.g. day1, day2, day4) |
| `label`    | string | Display name (e.g. "Day 1")                          |

### Steps block

List of protocol steps. Order in this list is reading convenience only; the
actual protocol flow is `entry_step` plus each step's `next_step` pointer,
never array position.

#### Step fields

A `step` has six required slots, all defined in
[PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md](PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md):

| Field            | Type                 | Required | Description                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `step_name`      | string               | yes      | Stable snake_case identifier for the step. Used for protocol flow, tests, and debugging.     |
| `prompt`         | string               | yes      | States what the student is asked to accomplish in this step.                                 |
| `sequence`       | list of interactions | yes      | The ordered list of `interaction` blocks that make up the step; order always matters.        |
| `step_validator` | mapping              | yes      | Named preset that checks whole-step completion. See "Validator presets".                     |
| `outcome`        | mapping              | yes      | The `{on_success, on_failure}` mapping that says how the step resolves.                      |
| `next_step`      | string or null       | yes      | The `step_name` of the next step, or `null` for a terminal step. The slot is always present. |

Optional step-level fields used for display only:

| Field        | Type            | Required | Description                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`      | string          | no       | Short display name shown in the protocol panel.                                    |
| `why`        | string          | no       | One-line rationale shown under the step card.                                      |
| `part_name`  | string          | no       | Reference to a part name in the parts block; UI grouping only.                     |
| `day_name`   | string          | no       | Reference to a day name in the days block; UI grouping only.                       |
| `step_index` | number          | no       | 1-based display position within the part. Display order only; never controls flow. |
| `scene`      | string          | no       | The scene this step's interactions happen in.                                      |
| `details`    | list of strings | no       | Short strings rendered as a bulleted side panel beneath the prompt.                |
| `tip`        | string          | no       | One sentence of professor guidance shown in the tip bubble next to the step prompt. Authoring real per-step tips is future content work (TODO). |

## The interaction block

Each entry in a step's `sequence` is one `interaction` block. An
`interaction` has exactly four literal slots:

| Slot        | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `target`    | string  | yes      | The semantic name of the scene object or control the student acts on. Geometry-free; the scene resolves the name. |
| `gesture`   | string  | yes      | How the student acts on the target. One of `click`, `drag`, `adjust`, `select`, `type`.                           |
| `validator` | mapping | yes      | Named preset that checks this one gesture on this one target. See "Validator presets".                            |
| `response`  | mapping | yes      | Container for post-validation behavior: `scene_operations` and optional `feedback`.                               |

There is no separate interaction task-type slot. The work a gesture does
is determined by the gesture plus the kind of target it lands on.

### The `response` container

A `response` has two fields:

| Field              | Type             | Required           | Description                                                                                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scene_operations` | list of mappings | yes (may be empty) | An ordered list of typed `scene_operation` primitives. Order matters; the runtime applies the list top to bottom. |
| `feedback`         | mapping          | no                 | Optional learner-facing messaging, structured into `correct` and `incorrect`.                                     |

A `scene_operation` requires a `type` field naming one of the five
ratified protocol-level primitives (`ObjectStateChange`, `CursorAttach`,
`SceneChange`, `LayoutMove`, `TimedWait`) plus that type's documented
typed fields. The full per-primitive field list lives in
[PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md](PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md). `SvgSwap` and `ColorChange`
are reclassified out of the protocol-level set into the object/render layer.
`LiquidDisplayChange` and `SetPointDisplayChange` are reclassified the same way:
liquid and set-point state mutation are expressed through `ObjectStateChange`
against the object's flat declared fields, and the object's `visual_states`
resolves how they appear. The protocol writes semantic state through
`ObjectStateChange` and never names an SVG asset id, a color value, a liquid
display update, or a set-point display update. The PascalCase type names are
the only non-snake_case identifiers in protocol YAML.

### Validator presets

Every `validator` and every `step_validator` is a named preset with typed
parameters, written as a mapping:

```yaml
validator: { preset: <name>, ...typed params }
```

The initial preset library has five presets (three interaction presets,
two step presets); their names and required fields are specified in
[PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md](PROTOCOL_VOCABULARY.md). A validator is never
free-form prose and never an inline expression.

A `select`-gesture interaction is validated by `correct_choice`, which is
target-equality on the selected scene object: the student chose the correct
next-step object among the present scene objects. It needs no `value` block.
A `type`-gesture interaction is validated by `target_with_value`: the
committed text is coerced to the type of the declared `value` field and
compared. Example shapes:

```yaml
# select: choose the correct next-step object among present objects
- target: pbs_bottle
  gesture: select
  validator: { preset: correct_choice }
# type: enter and commit a precise value
- target: cell_count_pad
  gesture: type
  validator: { preset: target_with_value, value: { entered_count: 42 } }
```

### The `outcome` mapping

`outcome` is a mapping with exactly two keys:

```yaml
outcome:
  on_success: complete
  on_failure: retry
```

`on_success: complete` resolves the step; flow then moves to `next_step`.
`on_failure: retry` restarts the whole step. The bare-scalar form
`outcome: complete` is rejected. `outcome` never advances the protocol --
that is `next_step`'s job.

## Domain verbs are authoring shorthand only

A domain verb (`wash`, `dispense`, `grind`, `assemble`, and so on) is
authoring vocabulary and documentation shorthand, not a protocol YAML
field. The executable YAML is always the expanded two-level model:
`step`, `sequence`, `target`, `gesture`, `validator`, `response`,
`scene_operations`, `step_validator`, `outcome`, `next_step`. This doc
documents the literal slot schema only and carries no domain-verb keys.
[PROTOCOL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md](PROTOCOL_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md) teaches with
domain verbs, but every domain verb it shows includes its explicit
expansion to literal slots. A future plan may add domain-verb macros,
but only after the expanded form is stable.

## Plate maps and grouped targets

The protocol YAML is geometry-free: it names no plate, no well, no tube,
no row, and no coordinate. Subparts of a structured object (wells, lanes,
slots) are declared by the object via `structure.subparts`; see
[OBJECT_VOCABULARY.md](OBJECT_VOCABULARY.md). A protocol addresses one
subpart as `<object_name>.<subpart_name>` (for example `treatment_plate.A1`).
A step that acts on several subparts emits one interaction per subpart.
Plate and tube
geometry lives on the object side; the protocol addresses subparts by
name only.

## Worked example: pbs_wash step

"Wash the flask with 4 mL PBS" is one step. It is the canonical
multi-gesture case, shown here as one step inside a `protocol`'s `steps`
list:

```yaml
protocol:
  protocol_name: cell_culture
  entry_step: pbs_wash
  steps:
    - step_name: pbs_wash
      prompt: "Wash the flask with 4 mL PBS."
      sequence:

### Step anatomy

- **Prompt** (`prompt`): the single thing the student is asked to
  accomplish in the step.
- **Sequence** (`sequence`): the ordered list of `interaction` blocks. Each
  is one `gesture` on one `target` with its own `validator` and `response`.
  Order always matters.
- **Interaction slots**: every interaction carries exactly `target`,
  `gesture`, `validator`, and `response`. There is no tool-first click
  field and no source or destination slot; the target's kind plus the
  gesture carries the task semantics.
- **Response** (`response`): `scene_operations` (an ordered list of typed
  primitives, possibly empty) plus optional `feedback`. State change is
  explicit in `scene_operation` mutations only.
- **Step validator** (`step_validator`): a named preset that checks
  whole-step completion after every interaction in the `sequence` has
  fired.
- **Outcome** (`outcome`): the `{on_success, on_failure}` mapping that
  resolves the step or restarts it.
- **Next step** (`next_step`): names the next step by its `step_name`, or
  `null` to mark a terminal step.

## Cross-file validation rules

The build process (`pipeline/build_protocol_data.py`) enforces these rules:

### Protocol structure

- Every `step_name` is unique and snake_case.
- `entry_step` names a declared step. `next_step` names a declared step or
  is `null`. Exactly one step has `next_step: null` (the terminal step).
- Walking `next_step` from `entry_step` visits every step (no orphans).
- `part_name` and `day_name`, when present, reference declared `parts` and
  `days`.
- `scene`, when present, names a declared scene.

### Interaction validation

- Every `interaction` carries exactly the four slots `target`, `gesture`,
  `validator`, and `response`.
- Every `target` value resolves to a scene object or to a declared subpart
  of a structured object (`<object_name>.<subpart_name>`) through the scene's
  adapter registry; see [SCENE_YAML_FORMAT.md](SCENE_YAML_FORMAT.md) and
  [OBJECT_VOCABULARY.md](OBJECT_VOCABULARY.md). Explicit subparts only;
  the vocabulary has no named-group construct.
- `gesture` is one of `click`, `drag`, `adjust`, `select`, `type`.
- `validator` and `step_validator` each name a preset from the documented
  preset library, with that preset's required typed parameters.
- `response.scene_operations` is a list (possibly empty); every entry has a
  `type` naming one of the five ratified protocol-level `scene_operation`
  primitives (`ObjectStateChange`, `CursorAttach`, `SceneChange`,
  `LayoutMove`, `TimedWait`) plus that type's documented typed fields.

### Outcome validation

- Every `step` has an `outcome` mapping with exactly the keys `on_success`
  and `on_failure`. The bare-scalar form `outcome: complete` is rejected.

### Asset validation

- Every item with an `asset` field has a corresponding file in
  `assets/equipment/<asset>.svg`. Items with `role: virtual_target` may omit `asset`.

### Hygiene rules

- ASCII-only across all YAML. UTF-8 glyphs escaped per [../MARKDOWN_STYLE.md](../MARKDOWN_STYLE.md)
  (e.g. `&alpha;`, `&micro;`).
- Every material entry in materials.yaml must be referenced by at least one
  `scene_operation` (an `ObjectStateChange` writing the material name into
  an object's flat `material_name` or `held_material_name` `state_field`; the
  field's declared `enum` `allowed` list is the binding reference). Catches dead materials.

## Generated TypeScript surface

This section describes the TypeScript the builder emits today. The
generated identifiers below are runtime output keys, not protocol YAML
keys; the canonical YAML schema authors write is the two-level model
documented above.

The Python builder (`pipeline/build_protocol_data.py`) compiles YAML into two
TypeScript modules at `generated/` (gitignored; consumed via the authored
facades `src/protocol.ts` and `src/inventory.ts`):

### generated/protocol_data.ts

```typescript
export const PROTOCOL_STEPS: readonly ProtocolStep[] = [
  // auto-generated from content/protocols/runners/cell_culture_full/protocol.yaml
  { id: 'spray_hood', label: '...', ... },
  { id: 'gather_supplies', label: '...', ... },
  // ... remaining steps ...
];

export const PROTOCOL_PARTS: readonly Record<string, ProtocolPart> = {
  // keyed by part id
  part1_split: { part_name: 'part1_split', label: 'Part 1: Split', day_name: 'day1' },
  // ...
};

export const PROTOCOL_DAYS: readonly Record<string, ProtocolDay> = {
  // keyed by day id
  day1: { id: 'day1', label: 'Day 1' },
  // ...
};
```

### generated/inventory_data.ts

```typescript
export const EQUIPMENT: readonly Record<string, InventoryItem> = {
  // keyed by item id
  serological_pipette: { label: 'Serological pipette', role: 'transfer_tool', ... },
  // ...
};

export const REAGENTS: readonly Record<string, InventoryReagent> = {
  // keyed by reagent id
  pbs: { label: '1x PBS', display_color: '#b8e5ff' },
  // ...
};
```

Scene code imports and consumes these exports directly; no YAML parsing happens
at runtime. The generated types are read-only arrays and records, enforcing
immutability at compile time. The `display_color` field is a single scalar hex
string, as authored in `materials.yaml` (see
[MATERIAL_YAML_FORMAT.md](MATERIAL_YAML_FORMAT.md)).

## Stable-name discipline

Every cross-reference uses the snake_case `_name` handles (`protocol_name`,
`step_name`, `object_name`, `field_name`, `part_name`, `day_name`,
`placement_name`), never display labels. Labels are free to change without
breaking the build; the `_name` handles are durable.

## Material reference model

Material entries are referenced in protocol steps through `ObjectStateChange`
`scene_operations`. An `ObjectStateChange` targeting an object or subpart
writes material names into the object's flat material `state_fields`
(`material_name`, `held_material_name`):

```yaml
- type: ObjectStateChange
  target: serological_pipette
  state:
    held_material_name: pbs
    held_material_volume: 4
```

The builder verifies that every material name written by an `ObjectStateChange`
is declared in the protocol's `materials.yaml` file.
