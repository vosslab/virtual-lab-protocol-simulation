# Material YAML format

This document is the canonical schema for the `materials.yaml` authoring file:
its top-level shape, the per-material keys, which keys are required, the exact
scalar `display_color` format, the closed-schema rule that rejects unknown keys,
the per-protocol scope of the registry, and whether sentinels appear in the
file. It also fixes the material-openness decision (D1) for how a subpart
`material_name` validates.

This is the schema-only doc. It does not define the closed material terms, the
sentinel/visible classification, the render-effect or target tokens, the color
resolver contract, or the validator and cross-YAML rules. Those live in their
owning docs:

- The closed material terms (material, sentinel, visible material, registry,
  mixture, waste, transfer) and the settled sentinel/visible classification are
  defined in [MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md](MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md).
- The design rationale (why color is a single scalar, why protocol YAML never
  names a color, why empty is transparent) is in
  [MATERIAL_DESIGN.md](MATERIAL_DESIGN.md).
- The runtime render convention (render effects, targets, identity and amount
  layers, fill behavior) is in [MATERIAL_CONVENTION.md](MATERIAL_CONVENTION.md).
- The validator behavior and cross-YAML agreement rules live in
  `MATERIAL_LINT.md`.

Where a term is used below, it is used with the meaning fixed in
[MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md](MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md).

## File location and scope

A material registry is authored per protocol. Each protocol package owns exactly
one registry file:

```
content/protocols/<cluster>/<protocol_name>/materials.yaml
```

This is one of the closed set of approved authoring files (see
[SPEC_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md](SPEC_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md)). No other path is a valid
material registry, and there is no global materials file. A material name
resolves against the active protocol's registry, not a shared table. Two
protocols that both register `media` each carry their own entry; the entries are
independent and may differ in `label` or `display_color`.

## Top-level shape

The file has exactly one top-level key, `materials`, whose value is a mapping.
Each key of that mapping is a material name (the snake_case identifier defined in
[MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md](MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md)); each value is a material
entry. An empty registry is written as `materials: {}`.

```yaml
materials:
  <material_name>:
    label: "<human display label>"
    display_color: "<scalar hex string>"
```

No other top-level key is allowed. Material names are the registry keys; a
material name is never repeated, because YAML mapping keys are unique.

## Material entry schema

A material entry is a closed schema with exactly two keys, both required, no
optional keys:

| Field           | Required | Type          | Allowed values                                                                 | Meaning                                                                  |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`         | yes      | string        | Non-empty string. ASCII only; non-ASCII glyphs are written as HTML entities.   | Human display label shown to the student (for example `"1x PBS"`).       |
| `display_color` | yes      | string        | A single scalar hex string in the format fixed in "Scalar display_color" below. | The visible material's color; the sole source of that material's color. |

Both keys are required on every entry. There are no optional keys and no defaults:
an entry missing either key, or carrying any third key, fails validation.

There is no material-kind field (no `liquid` / `solid` / `gel` / `powder` enum).
A material kind is not authored until a non-liquid material needs distinct
behavior; adding one is a vocabulary edit, not an author-introduced key.

### Material name (registry key)

The mapping key is the material name. It is a snake_case identifier matching
`^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` (lowercase letter first, then lowercase letters, digits, and
underscores). It names a substance or condition, never a color, asset, or volume.
The two sentinels (`empty`, `mixed`) are not registry keys; see "Sentinels do not
appear in materials.yaml" below.

### `label`

`label` is a non-empty human-readable string used as the display name. It is
ASCII-only per [MARKDOWN_STYLE.md](../MARKDOWN_STYLE.md) and the repo ASCII rule;
characters outside ASCII are written as HTML entities (for example `&micro;M
carboplatin`, `&beta;-mercaptoethanol`). `label` is free display text, not an
identifier, and is never used for resolution or matching.

### Scalar display_color

`display_color` is a single scalar hex color string. It is the only color surface
for a material. There is no nested mapping, no `light` / `dark` split, and no
theme branch: the project targets light scientific workspaces only, and the one
scalar color is used everywhere the material renders.

Allowed format:

- A string beginning with `#` followed by exactly six hexadecimal digits
  (`#rrggbb`). The pattern is `^#[0-9a-f]{6}$`.
- Hex digits are lowercase. `#a719db` is valid; `#A719DB` is rejected.
- No shorthand three-digit form (`#abc`), no eight-digit alpha form
  (`#rrggbbaa`), no named colors (`red`), and no `rgb(...)` / `hsl(...)`
  functional syntax.

```yaml
display_color: "#a719db"
```

A non-`empty` material name that resolves to no color is a resolver failure, not
a silent invisible success; that invariant is fixed in
[MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md](MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md) and surfaced by the resolver,
not by this schema. This schema's job is to require the field and fix its format.

## Glyph rendering

This is the canonical statement of the author-entity -> codegen-decode ->
DOM-glyph convention. Every other spec that states the ASCII/entity escaping
rule for an authored string (material `label` above, object unit strings and
labels, protocol prompts, descriptions, and feedback) cross-links here rather
than restating it.

- Authors write non-ASCII characters as named or numeric HTML entities in
  committed YAML (for example `&micro;M`, `&alpha;`, `&#181;`). The committed
  source stays ASCII, satisfying the repo-wide rule in
  [../MARKDOWN_STYLE.md](../MARKDOWN_STYLE.md).
- Codegen decodes each entity to its Unicode character at the string-emit
  choke point, so `generated/**` carries the real glyph (for example U+00B5,
  the micro sign) instead of the literal entity text. `generated/**` carries
  no ASCII restriction, so a decoded Unicode character in build output is not
  a violation.
- The runtime renders the decoded string as a plain DOM text node, never
  `innerHTML`. Decoding to a text node keeps the path free of HTML injection
  and entity-expansion risk regardless of which entity was authored.
- Both named entities (`&micro;`, `&alpha;`, `&beta;`, `&mu;`, and similar)
  and numeric entities (`&#181;`, `&#xB5;`) decode. A named entity outside the
  decode map that is not numeric is left verbatim: a visible, safe
  pass-through rather than a silent failure.
- This convention applies to every generated text path that can carry an
  entity: material `label` (this doc), object unit strings and labels, and
  protocol prompts, descriptions, feedback, and learning-hook text.

## Closed schema: unknown keys rejected

The entry schema is closed. The only allowed keys in a material entry are `label`
and `display_color`. Any other key (for example `color`, `colour`, `hex`,
`theme`, `light`, `dark`, `kind`, `metadata`, `notes`, `description`) is a
validation error. The only allowed top-level key is `materials`. Authors cannot
expand the material vocabulary by adding a key; new meaning requires a vocabulary
edit, per the schema-escape-hatch rule in
[SPEC_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md](SPEC_DESIGN_CHECKLIST.md).

## Sentinels do not appear in materials.yaml

The two sentinels are exempt from registration and must not be authored as
registry entries:

- `empty` is the non-rendering sentinel; it carries no color and is never an
  entry. A container holding `empty` (or `material_volume: 0`) renders no fill.
- `mixed` is the one built-in visible material; its color is a spec-defined
  built-in (owned by [MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md](MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md)), not an
  authored entry. Writing a `mixed` entry into `materials.yaml` is a validation
  error.

Every other material name a protocol writes into a `material_name` /
`held_material_name` field is a registry-backed visible material and must appear
as an entry in that protocol's `materials.yaml`. The settled per-name
classification table is in [MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md](MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md).

## D1: material-name openness decision

The decision (D1): a structured-container subpart `material_name` (and any
`material_name` / `held_material_name`) validates by **registry-backed
membership**, not against a single global closed enum. The accepted value set is
the union of the closed sentinel allowlist and the active protocol's registry
keys.

### Validation predicate

For a written material-name value `m` under active protocol `P`:

```
valid(m, P)  ==  m in {empty, mixed}            # closed sentinel allowlist
              OR m in registry_keys(P)          # keys of P's materials.yaml `materials` map
```

- `registry_keys(P)` is the set of top-level keys under `materials:` in
  `content/protocols/<cluster>/<P>/materials.yaml`.
- The sentinel allowlist `{empty, mixed}` is the closed set fixed in
  [MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md](MATERIAL_VOCABULARY.md); it is not extended here.
- Any `m` that satisfies neither clause is an unregistered-material error (the
  stepper's `s-unregistered` gate; see `MATERIAL_LINT.md`).

### Why registry-backed, not a closed enum

- A shared structured object such as `well_plate_96` must not enumerate every
  drug, buffer, or assay product any protocol might place in a well. A closed
  enum on the object would force an object edit for every new curriculum
  treatment, recoupling the object layer to protocol content and breaking the
  closed-by-id object rule (objects do not change identity to host new content).
- The registry-backed model keeps the curriculum's treatments where they belong:
  each protocol registers the materials it uses in its own `materials.yaml`, and
  the shared object validates membership dynamically against that per-protocol
  registry plus the two sentinels.
- The set is still closed per protocol: each registry entry is a closed-schema
  entry, and an author cannot invent a material name by writing it into protocol
  YAML alone -- the name must also be registered (or be a sentinel), or the
  `s-unregistered` gate rejects it. Openness is bounded registration, not a
  free-form string.

### Handoff to stepper and YAML

- The Python stepper (WP-STEPPER) implements `valid(m, P)` exactly as the
  predicate above: sentinel-or-registry membership, evaluated against the active
  protocol's loaded registry.
- The shared `well_plate_96` object (WP-YAML) needs no per-subpart enum of
  material names; its subpart `material_name` field is validated by the predicate
  above, not by an object-declared value list.

## Examples

Every key shown below appears in the entry schema table above; the examples
illustrate the schema and do not extend it.

Minimal single-entry registry:

```yaml
materials:
  pbs:
    label: "1x PBS"
    display_color: "#076dad"
```

Multiple entries, including a condition pair and a tracked mixture (each
condition and each mixture is its own material name with its own scalar color):

```yaml
materials:
  media:
    label: "Growth media"
    display_color: "#6c6c00"
  spent_media:
    label: "Spent media"
    display_color: "#935d00"
  carboplatin:
    label: "Carboplatin solution"
    display_color: "#a719db"
  metformin:
    label: "Metformin solution"
    display_color: "#00775f"
  carboplatin_metformin_combo:
    label: "Carboplatin and metformin mixture"
    display_color: "#b84db8"
```

A label carrying a non-ASCII glyph, written as an HTML entity:

```yaml
materials:
  carboplatin_4umol:
    label: "4 &micro;M carboplatin"
    display_color: "#a719db"
```

An empty registry (a protocol that writes only sentinels):

```yaml
materials: {}
```

The sentinels `empty` and `mixed` never appear as entries in any example above,
because they are not registered.
