# M0 layout parity: fixed 16:9 precompute vs live panel

Work package WP-FEAS1. Proves the existing layout engine produces the same `ComputedItem[]` at a canonical 16:9 precompute viewport as at a live 16:9 panel, so layout can move to compile time behind the 16:9 contract.

## Verdict

- Go signal: GO
- Scenes checked: 34
- Scenes passing parity + scene_name keying: 34
- All scenes exact bit-for-bit (no epsilon needed): yes
- Viewport sweep correct: yes

## Reproducibility parameters

- Precompute (canonical) viewport: 1920x1080
- Live panel viewport (parity control): 1280x720 (same 16:9 aspect, different pixel size)
- Sort order (serialization): items sorted ascending by `placement_name` before diffing, stable string compare.
- Serialization method: field-by-field compare over the ComputedItem fields the renderer reads (_scale, _centerX, _baselineY, _top, _visualWidth, _height, _footprint, _labelX, _labelY, _labelLines).
- Numeric tolerance: 1e-9 absolute (IEEE-754 noise only).
- Tolerance rationale: same-aspect 16:9 viewports run identical floating-point arithmetic in `vertical_layout.ts` (the only viewport-dependent term is `viewport.w / viewport.h`, identical for any 16:9 size), so exact equality is the expectation. The epsilon absorbs representational noise only; the report flags any non-exact match.

The consumed-artifact column compares `PRECOMPUTED_LAYOUT[scene].final` (generated/precomputed_layout.ts, the exact array the browser production path renders under WP-PRECOMP2) against the runtime engine at the canonical 16:9 frame. `match` means the build artifact is byte-current with the engine.

## Viewport sweep

Each viewport is compared against the canonical 16:9 frame, aggregated across every scene. Only the 16:9 rows are gated: in the browser the CSS (`.scene-panel-inner { aspect-ratio: 16 / 9 }`) locks the panel to 16:9, so the live path always presents a 16:9 viewport and must move no field. The off-16:9 rows are contrast controls that document why the lock matters: a different PX_PER_SCENE_PERCENT factor shifts `_height` for every item and cascades into `_width_scale`, `_centerX`, and the rest. That is genuine per-aspect reflow, not pure letterboxing -- exactly the behavior the 16:9 contract removes. These rows are reported, not failed.

## Static-layout evidence (re-confirmed)

- `LayoutMove` is a no-op: `src/scene_runtime/protocol/scene_op_deps.ts` `apply_layout_move` warns and does not mutate layout.
- `ObjectStateChange` changes object state and appearance only; it does not re-run the layout pipeline.
- No resize listener: `src/protocol_host.tsx` measures `#scene-root` once via `getBoundingClientRect` at scene render; it registers no resize handler.
- Fixed placement set: the placement set is resolved once per scene load; `SceneChange` re-runs the same `render_protocol_scene` path keyed by `scene_name` (`SCENES[next_scene_name]`).

## SceneChange keying

`protocol_host.render_protocol_scene` resolves a scene as `SCENES[next_scene_name]`. A precomputed-layout map keyed by `scene_name` is reachable by the identical key; every scene self-reports its key (`scene.scene_name === scene_name`), confirmed in the per-scene table.

## Excluded scenes

- long_labels_smoke: absent from generated SCENES: scene validation error (placement references unknown object 'dmf_bottle'); never lays out, so it cannot be a parity subject. Exclusion is unrelated to viewport aspect.

## Blockers

- None.
