"""
Codegen helper that decodes HTML entities in authored YAML strings to their
Unicode characters before emission into generated/**.

Authors write ASCII HTML entities in YAML (the git-committed source stays
ASCII, per docs/specs/MATERIAL_YAML_FORMAT.md). decode_entities turns each
entity into its Unicode character so codegen can emit a real glyph into
generated/**, which the runtime then renders as a normal DOM text node (never
innerHTML). This is a closed-set dictionary lookup, not XML entity expansion,
so it carries no XXE risk.

An entity not in the named map and not a valid numeric form is left verbatim
in the output, a visible and safe pass-through.
