"""Scene YAML loading and inheritance resolution.

This module provides helpers for loading scene YAML files and resolving single-level
scene inheritance. It wraps existing toolkit functions (yaml_io, objects, paths) and
adds SVG viewBox parsing and inheritance resolution specific to scenes.

Inheritance is limited to single-level extends chains; multi-level, cyclic, and
dangling references raise typed exceptions. Locked-field mutations (modifications to
fields that the inheritance system protects) are detected and reported.

	Resolve single-level scene inheritance and return a new scene dict.

	Args:
		scene: The scene dict to resolve (loaded from YAML).
		base_scenes_dir: Directory containing base scene files. If None, uses

		A new dict with inheritance resolved and operations applied. The returned
		dict does not include the 'extends' field.

		UnknownBaseError: If a base scene cannot be loaded.
		MultiLevelInheritanceError: If the base scene also has an 'extends' field.
