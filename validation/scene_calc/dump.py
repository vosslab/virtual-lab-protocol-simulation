"""Scene geometry loader: reads rendered geometry from stats.json.

The browser pipeline (tools/scene_to_png.mjs -> tools/scene_stats.mjs) is the
single source of truth for scene layout geometry. It renders every shipped scene
through the real TypeScript layout pipeline and writes the rendered bounding
boxes to test-results/scenes/<scene>.stats.json under a "geometry" block.

This module is a thin LOADER. It does not compute layout. It reads the rendered
geometry block and returns the dict shape the downstream consumers
(validation.scene_lint group B rules, validation.scene_design metrics) expect.
There is no Python geometry model; the validator follows the generator.

See docs/active_plans/decisions/scene_calc_validator_follows_generator.md.

Coordinate space: all boxes are CSS pixels with a top-left origin, from one
render. Placement-level bboxes (visual_bbox, placement_bbox, footprint_bbox,
label_bbox) use {x, y, w, h} keys. Scene bounds, zone bounds, and zone
inner_rect use {left, right, top, bottom} edge-coordinate form. Every box in a
single returned dict shares one pixel space, so rules that compare boxes against
each other and against zone rects are unit-consistent.

If the stats.json for a scene is missing, stale, or carries no geometry block
(load-failed render), this loader raises RuntimeError. It never synthesizes
geometry. The fix is to re-render (node tools/scene_to_png.mjs --all), not to
predict layout in Python.
