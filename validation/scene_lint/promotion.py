"""Promotion policy and strict mode for Group B rules.

A B-rule is promoted to strict mode only when its confusion-table metrics
meet the promotion bar: precision >= 0.90, recall >= 0.80, and >= 20
ground-truth positive labels in the labeled corpus.

Promotion configuration lives at validation/scene_lint/promotions.yaml
with a closed schema:
  - rule: str (B-rule name, not Group A)
  - promoted_at: str (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - precision: float (metric at promotion time)
  - recall: float (metric at promotion time)
  - positive_count: int (positive labels in corpus at promotion time)
  - low_confidence_approved: bool (default False; allows low-confidence
    findings on this rule to contribute to strict-mode failures)

At load time, each promotion entry is re-validated against the current
labeled corpus. If current precision < 0.90, recall < 0.80, or
positive_count < 20, the rule is emitted as a promotion_below_bar advisory
finding and remains advisory (not strict).

Strict mode exits 1 on any ESCAPE_REQUIRED finding from a successfully-
promoted rule (when --strict is passed).
