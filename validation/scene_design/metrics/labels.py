"""Label hygiene metrics: text readable, not packed.

Implements three label hygiene metrics defined in SCENE_DESIGN_LINT_PLAN.md
section "Label hygiene - text readable, not packed":

  predicted_label_overlap    - fraction of placements whose label_bbox intersects
                               another placement's footprint_bbox or label_bbox
  label_to_object_distance   - average gap between label_bbox and footprint_bbox
  label_wrap_rate            - fraction of placements whose label spans multiple lines

Each function accepts the scene YAML dict and dump_data dict produced by
validation.scene_calc.dump.dump_scene_geometry, and returns a float in [0, 100]
or None when required data is absent (NotReady semantics).

Dump schema reference:
  dump_data['placements'] is a list of dicts with keys:
    placement_name, kind, asset_path, visual_bbox, footprint_bbox,
    placement_bbox, label_bbox, aspect_delta_pct, scale_source
  Each bbox is {x, y, w, h} (placement-level; x=left, y=top, w=width, h=height).
  dump_data['scene_bounds'] is {left, right, top, bottom} in scene-%.

	Definition (SCENE_DESIGN_LINT_PLAN.md "Label hygiene"):
	  Stage 9 residual collisions after 3-pass nudge.
	  Target: 0 collisions (score 100).

	A label_bbox is considered overlapping if it intersects with any other
	placement's footprint_bbox or label_bbox (excluding itself). Score is
	100 minus the overlap fraction scaled to 0-100.

	Formula:
	  overlap_fraction = overlapping_count / total_count

	This means any overlap drives the score below 100, and a scene where
	all labels overlap scores 0.

	Returns None if dump_data has fewer than 2 placements (no pair to compare)
	or if placements key is missing.

	Args:
		scene: Parsed scene YAML dict. (Not used; included for API uniformity.)
		dump_data: Dump dict from dump_scene_geometry.
