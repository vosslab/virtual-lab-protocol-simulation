"""Composition health metrics: structural variety and authoring quality.

Implements three composition health metrics defined in SCENE_DESIGN_LINT_PLAN.md
section "Composition health":

  tab_stops_symmetry  - distribution evenness of placement left-edges
  depth_tier_usage    - fraction of available z/depth tiers used
  aspect_fidelity     - mean inverse of predicted aspect distortion

Each function accepts the scene YAML dict and dump_data dict produced by
validation.scene_calc.dump.dump_scene_geometry, and returns a float in [0, 100]
or None when required data is absent (NotReady semantics).

Dump schema reference (WP-SIM-2 pinned):
  dump_data['placements'] is a list of dicts with keys:
    placement_name, kind, asset_path, visual_bbox, footprint_bbox,
    placement_bbox, label_bbox, aspect_delta_pct, scale_source
  Each bbox is {x, y, w, h} (placement-level; x=left, y=top, w=width, h=height).
  dump_data['scene_bounds'] is {left, right, top, bottom} in scene-%.

	Measures how evenly placement left-edges (tab-stops) are distributed
	across the scene width. Divides the scene width into three equal columns
	(left, center, right) and sums the footprint width of placements whose
	left-edge falls in each column. Score penalizes imbalance between columns.

	Formula:
	  Divide scene width into thirds: left, center, right.
	  For each populated column, sum footprint widths of placements
	  whose footprint_bbox.x falls within that column.
	  ratio = max_sum / min_sum over populated columns.

	Definition (SCENE_DESIGN_LINT_PLAN.md "Composition health"):
	  does the scene exercise tiers 1/2/3 or is it flat;
	  scenes with >=5 placements should use >=2 tiers.

	Depth tiers are inferred from the z value in scene YAML placements, or
	from zone association (rear zones = tier 1, center/front zones = tier 2,
	explicit foreground = tier 3). Three total tiers are assumed.

	Implementation uses z values from scene YAML placements when present.
	A unique z value counts as a distinct tier. When z values are absent,
	zone names are used as a proxy (rear* = 1, front*/foreground* = 3,
	else = 2). The score rewards using more of the 3 available tiers.

	Formula:

	it as a continuous score component. A scene where all placements have
	0% distortion scores 100; distortion reduces the score proportionally.
