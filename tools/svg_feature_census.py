"""
Feature census for the wild SVG corpus under OTHER_REPOS/.

Answers "how many SVGs had clipping and other normalization requirements"
independent of the accept/reject verdict. A file can carry a clipPath and
still be rejected for an unrelated reason (text, filter), so the primary
rejection reason alone undercounts feature prevalence. This census walks
every element of every SVG and records, per file, whether each
normalization-relevant feature is present. It then cross-tabulates feature
presence against the current v3 verdict.

Read-only: parses inputs, writes only the two report artifacts. It never
writes normalized SVGs and never mutates the corpus.

Outputs:
